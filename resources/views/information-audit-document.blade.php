                 <li> Exemption where the controller cannot identify the data subject : If RapidBrains cannot identify the data subject, RapidBrains is exempt from the application of certain rights of that data subject.</li>  
                 <li> Time limits for complying with the rights of data subjects : RapidBrains is obliged to give effect to the rights of data subjects within specified time periods, in order to avoid the frustration of those rights through excessive delays.</li>

</li>  
                 <li>The right to restrict processing: In some circumstances, data subjects may not be entitled to require RapidBrains to erase their personal data, but may be entitled to limit the purposes for which the RapidBrains can process those data (e.g., the exercise or defence of legal claims; protecting the rights of another person or entity; purposes that serve a substantial public interest; or such other purposes as the data subject may consent to). </li>  
                 <li> Notifying third parties regarding rectification, erasure or restriction: Where a controller has disclosed personal data to any third parties, and the data subject has subsequently exercised any of the rights of rectification, erasure or blocking, the controller must notify those third parties of the data subject’s exercising of those rights. The controller is exempt from this obligation if it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort.</li>  
                 <li> Right of data portability: Data subjects have the right to transfer their personal data between controllers (e.g., to move account details from one online
